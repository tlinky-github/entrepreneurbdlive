**Passion starts businesses. Financial illiteracy kills them.**

A staggering 82% of small businesses fail due to cash flow challenges, not product failure. In Bangladesh, many founders are brilliant product visionaries but terrible CFOs. They confuse "Sales" with "Profit," "Bank Balance" with "Equity," and "Invoice" with "Cash."

You don't need to be a Chartered Accountant (CA) to run a business. But you do need to master the language of money. If you cannot read a balance sheet, you are flying a plane blindfolded.

This guide simplifies the complex world of finance into actionable habits for the Bangladeshi entrepreneur.

## Part 1: The Three Holy Documents

If you hire an accountant, don't just ask them to "file tax." Ask them to explain these three documents to you every month.

### 1. Income Statement (Profit & Loss / P&L)
*   **What it is:** A video recording of your business over time (e.g., January 1 to January 31).
*   **Formula:** Revenue - Expenses = Net Income.
*   **The Trap:** You can be "Profitable" on paper but have no cash (if clients haven't paid you).

### 2. Balance Sheet
*   **What it is:** A snapshot photo of your business at a specific moment (e.g., As of Jan 31).
*   **Formula:** Assets = Liabilities + Equity.
*   **Key Insight:** It shows if your business is "solvent." Do you owe more than you own?

### 3. Cash Flow Statement (The King)
*   **What it is:** Tracks actual cash entering and leaving your bank account.
*   **Why it matters:** You pay salaries with cash, not with profits. Cash flow kills businesses faster than anything else. You must know your "Burn Rate" (how much cash you lose per month).

## Part 2: Unit Economics (The Atomic Level)

Do you know exactly how much you make on *one* sale?

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
How much marketing money do you spend to get one customer?
*   **Formula:** Total Ad Spend / New Customers.
*   **Example:** You spend BDT 10,000 on Facebook Ads and get 20 orders. Your CAC is BDT 500.

### Lifetime Value (LTV)
How much profit does that customer give you over their entire life?
*   **Example:** They buy a BDT 1000 product. Profit is BDT 300. They buy 3 times a year for 2 years. LTV = 300 * 3 * 2 = BDT 1800.

### The Golden Ratio
**LTV:CAC > 3:1.**
If you spend BDT 500 to make BDT 1800, you are healthy. If you spend BDT 500 to make BDT 600, you are dying a slow death.

## Part 3: Managing Burn and Runway

### Gross Burn vs. Net Burn
*   **Gross Burn:** Total money leaving the bank (Salaries + Rent + Server).
*   **Net Burn:** Gross Burn - Revenue. (If you spend 5 Lakh and earn 3 Lakh, Net Burn is 2 Lakh).

### Runway
*   **Formula:** Cash in Bank / Net Burn.
*   **Example:** You have BDT 20 Lakh in the bank. Net burn is 2 Lakh. Runway = 10 Months.
*   **The Zero Date:** Mark the date on your calendar when money runs out. This clarity creates urgency.

## Part 4: Tax and Compliance Realities

In Bangladesh, there are two certainties: Traffic and Taxes.

### VAT (Mushak)
*   **Misconception:** New founders think VAT is an expense. It is not. It is a liability.
*   **Reality:** When a customer pays you BDT 115 (100 + 15 VAT), that 15 taka is *not yours*. You are holding it for the government. Spending it is a crime. Keep it in a separate account.

### AIT (Advance Income Tax)
Be aware that corporate clients will deduct tax (usually 10-20%) before paying you. Your BDT 100 invoice effectively puts BDT 80 in your pocket. Plan your cash flow for this gap.

## Part 5: Case Study: The "Profitable" Agency

**Scenario:** An agency has BDT 50 Lakh in signed contracts. On paper, they are rich.
**Reality:** Clients pay Net-60 (60 days later).
**Crisis:** The founder cannot pay salaries this month because the bank balance is zero.
**Lesson:** Revenue is Vanity. Cash is Reality. The founder learned to demand 50% upfront payment to solve the cash gap.

## Part 6: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Should I hire a CFO?**
A: Not until you are doing BDT 5-10 Crore revenue. Before that, specific a part-time accountant or a firm is sufficient.

**Q: Is debt bad?**
A: Debt is leverage. If you can borrow at 9% interest and earn 20% return on that money (by buying inventory), debt is good. If you borrow to pay salaries, debt is fatal.

## Conclusion

Financial literacy is empowerment. When you understand the numbers, you stop making decisions based on "gut feeling" and start making them based on facts. You negotiate better with suppliers (knowing your margins), you impress investors (knowing your CAC), and most importantly, you sleep better at night knowing you aren't going to run out of cash tomorrow.
