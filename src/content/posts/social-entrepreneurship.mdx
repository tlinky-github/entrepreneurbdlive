**Profit is not a dirty word. But in 2026, Profit without Purpose is a dying model.**

Social Entrepreneurship is the hybrid sweet spot between the efficiency of a business and the heart of an NGO. It uses market mechanisms to solve social problems. In Bangladesh, the birthplace of Microfinance (Grameen Bank) and the world's largest NGO (BRAC), using business for social good is in our blood.

But the new generation of "Social Enterprises" looks different. They aren't relying on foreign aid. They are venture-backed, tech-enabled, and highly profitable.

This guide explores how to build a company that makes money *and* makes a difference.

## Part 1: Charity vs. Social Business (The Distinction)

Understanding the difference is critical.

### The Charity Model
*   **Funding:** Donations / Grants.
*   **Mechanism:** Give things away for free.
*   **The Flaw:** Sustainability. If the donor stops giving, the work stops. You spend 50% of your time fundraising.

### The Social Business Model
*   **Funding:** Revenue / Investment.
*   **Mechanism:** Sell a product/service to solve a problem.
*   **The Power:** Independence. The more you sell, the more impact you create. The profit is reinvested to scale the impact.
*   **Example:** **Aarong**. It is not a charity. It is a premium retail brand. But its supply chain lifts thousands of rural artisans out of poverty.

## Part 2: Models of Impact

You don't have to reinvent the wheel. Here are proven models.

### 1. The Buy-One-Give-One (Transformation)
*   **Concept:** For every product sold, one is donated. (e.g., TOMS Shoes).
*   **Critique:** Sometimes this kills local markets.
*   **Evolution:** Instead of giving a shoe, give *impact*. Sell a shoe, fund a day of school.

### 2. The Employment Model
*   **Concept:** Your impact is *who* you hire.
*   **Example:** A bakery that exclusively hires victims of domestic violence or people with disabilities. The product is just bread, but the *process* is the impact.

### 3. The Market Linkage Model
*   **Concept:** Cutting out exploitative middlemen.
*   **Example:** **iFarmer**. Farmers used to sell to "Farias" at low prices. iFarmer connects them to investors and retailers, increasing their income by 30%.

## Part 3: Measuring Impact (SROI)

Investors are now asking for SROI (Social Return on Investment).
*   **The Metric:** "For every BDT 100 invested, how much social value was created?"
*   **KPIs:**
    *   Lives touched.
    *   CO2 reduced.
    *   Jobs created for women.
    *   School attendance increased.
*   **Why it matters:** Impact Investors like **IIX** or **Roots of Impact** will not write a check unless you can prove these numbers.

## Part 4: The Legal Structure

In Bangladesh, there is no separate "Social Enterprise" legal entity. You are either:
1.  **Non-Profit:** Society / Trust / Section 28 Company. (Tax-exempt, but hard to raise equity).
2.  **For-Profit:** Private Limited Company. (Taxable, but can raise VC money).

*   **The Hybrid:** Most social entrepreneurs register as a Pvt Ltd Company but write their mission into their Articles of Association to protect the vision.

## Part 5: Case Study: 10 Minute School

**The Problem:** Quality education was restricted to expensive coaching centers in Dhaka. Rural students failed admission tests.
**The Product:** Free, high-quality video lessons.
**The Business Model:** Freemium. Corporate sponsorship and paid specialized courses fund the free content.
**The Impact:** Democratized education for 30 million students.
**The Lesson:** You can serve the poor and still build a multi-million dollar valuation.

## Part 6: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I take a salary?**
A: Yes! A social entrepreneur should be paid well. If you starve, the business dies. You are not a monk.

**Q: Do customers care about "Social Good"?**
A: Gen Z certainly does. 70% of Gen Z consumers prefer brands that stand for something. Your impact is your marketing differentiator.

## Conclusion

The next unicorn in Bangladesh shouldn't just be a billion-dollar company; it should impact a billion lives. The problems of poverty, clean water, education, and health are market failures—and market opportunities for the brave social entrepreneur.

Don't build a business just to make money. That's boring. Build a business to change the world, and get rich doing it.
