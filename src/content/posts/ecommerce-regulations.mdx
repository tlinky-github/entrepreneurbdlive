**The "Wild West" days of Bangladeshi eCommerce are over. The sheriff is in town.**

A few years ago, you could run a Facebook page, take pre-payments for motorcycles or fridges at 50% discount, and disappear. The scandals of Evaly, E-Orange, and Dhamaka changed everything. The government realized that to save the industry, it had to regulate it.

In 2026, operating an online business requires more than just a product photos. It requires **compliance**. The **Digital Commerce Operation Guidelines 2021** is the bible for online sellers.

This guide decodes the legal framework you must operate within to avoid being sued by the Directorate of National Consumer Rights Protection (DNCRP).

## Part 1: Registration and Identity

### The DBID (Digital Business ID)
Previously, small Facebook entrepreneurs (F-Commerce) couldn't get a Trade License because they operated from home. This excluded them from bank loans.
*   **The Solution:** The Ministry of Commerce introduced the DBID.
*   **Requirement:** Every online seller—website, app, or Facebook Page—must register.
*   **Benefit:** It legitimizes your business. A DBID holder can apply for SME loans. It also signals trust to customers who are scared of scams.

### Trade License for E-Commerce
If you have a physical office or warehouse, you need a Trade License.
*   **Category:** Ensure your license says "IT / E-Commerce" or "Online Supply."

## Part 2: The Core Operational Rules

### 1. Delivery Timelines (The 5-Day Rule)
This is the most critical operational rule in the guideline.
*   **Same City:** If you and the customer are in the same city (e.g., both in Dhaka), delivery must be attempted within **5 days** of order confirmation.
*   **Different City:** If inter-district (e.g., Dhaka to Chittagong), delivery must be attempted within **10 days**.
*   **Exceptions:** You can take longer for "Pre-Orders" or "Made to Measure" items, but ONLY if you explicitly state the timeline on the product page. Hiding the delay is illegal.

### 2. Payment and Escrow
The days of holding customer money for months are gone.
*   **Escrow Service:** For large marketplaces, payments are often held in an escrow service (like Bangladesh Bank's gateway) until delivery is confirmed.
*   **Refund Policy:** If you fail to deliver within the timeline, you must refund the money within **48 hours** (if paid digitally). You cannot charge any "cancellation fee" if the failure is on your side.

### 3. Stocks and Inventory
*   **The Rule:** You cannot sell a product you do not own or control.
*   **No "Air Selling":** You cannot take money for a product, *then* try to buy it from a supplier. You must have the stock (or a firm contract with the supplier) before accepting payment.
*   **Display:** Your website must display "In Stock" or "Out of Stock" accurately.

## Part 3: Consumer Rights & Returns

"No Returns" is no longer a valid policy. It is illegal.

### The Right to Information
Your website/page must clearly display:
*   Full Contact Address (Physical).
*   Phone Number and Email.
*   Detailed breakdown of price (Product + VAT + Delivery Charge).

### Defective Products
If a customer receives a product that is:
*   Damaged.
*   Wrong size/color.
*   Not as described.
*   **Liability:** The seller must bear the cost of the return delivery. You cannot ask the customer to pay for the return.

---

## Part 4: Data Privacy and Security

You are collecting customer names, numbers, and addresses.
*   **Spamming:** You cannot use their phone numbers for SMS marketing without their consent.
*   **Security:** If your database leaks, you are liable under the Digital Security Act.
*   **Third Party:** You cannot sell your customer list to other companies.

## Part 5: Case Study: The "Pre-Order" Trap

**Scenario:** A boutique sells "Pakistani Lawn Suits" on pre-order. They take 100% advance.
**The Problem:** The shipment from Pakistan gets stuck at customs for 2 months.
**The Violation:** They promised delivery in 15 days.
**The Consequence:** Customers complain to DNCRP. The Directorate fines the boutique BDT 50,000 and orders immediate refunds.
**The Fix:** The boutique should have stated "Delivery in 60 days" upfront or taken only a small booking money (10%) instead of full advance.

## Part 6: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: I only sell on Facebook. Do I need a website?**
A: Legally, no. But operationally, yes. Facebook is a rented platform. If they ban your ad account, you lose your business. A website with a proper domain is an asset you own.

**Q: Can I charge different prices for cash vs. card?**
A: No. The price must be the same. Discounting for cash is often a sign of tax evasion (hiding VAT).

**Q: What happens if the delivery company loses the parcel?**
A: The contract is between You (Seller) and the Customer. You are liable to the customer. You must refund them or send a replacement, and then *you* fight with the delivery company for compensation.

## Conclusion

Regulation creates a moat. By being fully compliant, displaying your DBID, and offering transparent returns, you differentiate yourself from the thousands of scammy pages.

In 2026, **Trust** is the highest currency in eCommerce. Compliance is how you earn it.

> [!WARNING]
> **Ad Policy:** Facebook's own ad policies are stricter than Bangladeshi law. Do not make false claims ("Whitens skin in 3 days"). You will be banned instantly, regardless of your DBID.
