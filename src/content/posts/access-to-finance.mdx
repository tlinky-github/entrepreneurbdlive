**"Where do I get the money?"**

This is the single most common question asked by aspiring entrepreneurs in Bangladesh. The misconception is that you need crores of takas to start. The reality is that money has a "cost," and "type." Understanding the different *types* of capital—and when to use them—is a critical skill that separates a small business owner from a scalable entrepreneur.

In 2026, the funding landscape has shifted from "Family Loans" to a sophisticated mix of Grants, Angels, VCs, and Impact Investors. This guide demystifies the "Capital Stack" and provides a roadmap for funding your venture at every stage.

## Part 1: The Bootstrapping Phase (Pre-Seed)

Before asking for outside money, look in the mirror. Bootstrapping means funding the business from your own savings and, more importantly, from *customer revenue*.

### Why Bootstrap?
*   **Total Control:** You answer to no one. You keep 100% equity.
*   **Discipline:** When you are spending your own money, you don't buy fancy office chairs. You buy inventory. This "frugality muscle" serves you well forever.
*   **The Customer is King:** Since you have no investors, your only way to survive is to make customers happy. This forces "Product-Market Fit."

### Friends and Family (The "Love Money")
This is usually the first external check ($5k - $10k).
*   **Structure:** Treat it professionally. Is it a gift? A loan? Or equity?
*   **The Danger:** Business failure can destroy relationships.
*   **The Strategy:** Use a "Convertible Note" structure—a loan that converts to equity later when you have a professional valuation.

## Part 2: Bank Loans (Debt Financing)

Banks in Bangladesh are traditionally risk-averse. They lend against *collateral* (land, FDR), not against *business plans*. However, policy shifts are changing this.

### SME Loans
Bangladesh Bank has mandated that banks allocate a % of their portfolio to SMEs.
*   **Collateral-Free Loans:** Banks like **BRAC Bank**, **City Bank**, and **IDLC** offering loans up to BDT 10-25 Lakh without collateral, solely based on cash flow.
*   **Requirement:** You need a Trade License, a physical office, and at least 6-12 months of solid bank statement history.

### The "Cost" of Debt
*   **Pros:** You don't lose ownership (Equity).
*   **Cons:** You must pay interest every month, regardless of profit. This puts pressure on cash flow.

## Part 3: Venture Capital & Angels (Equity Financing)

VCs give you money in exchange for ownership (shares) of your company. They expect massive growth (10x - 100x).

### Angel Investors
High-net-worth individuals (CXOs, Successful Founders) who invest their own money.
*   **Network:** **Bangladesh Angels Network (BAN)** is the premier platform connecting founders with angels. They hold regular pitch sessions.
*   **Value:** Good angels bring mentorship and connections (Intros to big clients) which is often worth more than the cash.

### Venture Capital (VC)
Institutional money.
*   **Who is it for?** Tech startups with scalable products (Software, Platforms). Not for restaurants or trading houses.
*   **The Trade-off:** You lose control. You have a board of directors. You are on a treadmill to grow fast or die.

## Part 4: The "Capital Stack" Strategy

Smart founders mix and match.
1.  **Stage 1 (Idea):** Bootstrap + Friends/Family. (Goal: Build MVP).
2.  **Stage 2 (Validation):** Angel Investment or Government Grant (IDEA Project). (Goal: Get first 100 customers).
3.  **Stage 3 (Growth):** Venture Capital. (Goal: Scale to 100,000 customers).
4.  **Stage 4 (Working Capital):** Bank financing / Bill factoring. (Goal: Manage cash flow gaps).

## Part 5: How to Prepare for Funding?

Investors and bankers look for the "3 Ts":
1.  **Team:** Do you have the grit and skill? Have you failed before?
2.  **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** Is the market big enough? Investing in a niche product for 500 people is not VC-fundable.
3.  **Traction:** Do you have paying customers? Traction trumps everything. A graph going up and to the right solves 90% of fundraising problems.

## Part 6: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How much equity should I give away?**
A: Standard dilution is 10-20% per round. If you give away 50% in your Seed round, you are "uninvestable" for future rounds because you won't have enough skin in the game.

**Q: What is a Valuation?**
A: In early stages, it is an art, not a science. It is what the market will pay. Don't obsess over a high valuation; obsess over clean terms (no toxic clauses).

**Q: Can I get a loan for a new idea?**
A: Almost never. Banks finance "operations," not "ideas." You need revenue history to get a loan.

**Lesson:** Chaldal used every layer of the capital stack at the right time.

## Conclusion

Money is fuel. But putting Ferrari fuel in a rickshaw won't make it go fast; it will burn the engine. Understand what kind of vehicle you are building (Lifestyle Business vs. High-Growth Startup) and choose the right fuel.

> [!NOTE]
> **Warning:** Fundraising is a full-time job. It takes 3-6 months. Ensure your co-founder is running the business while you are chasing investors, or the business will die while you are out raising money to save it.
