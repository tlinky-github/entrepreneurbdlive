**Passion starts a business; paperwork keeps it legal.**

In Bangladesh, the bureaucratic maze can be the first major hurdle for a new entrepreneur. What looks like a simple process often turns into a months-long saga of visiting government offices, paying "speed money" (intermediary fees), and dealing with confusing forms.

However, operating in the "shadows" without a license prevents you from opening a bank account, getting a loan, or signing corporate clients. Compliance is the price of admission for the big leagues.

This detailed guide serves as your checklist. It covers the non-negotiable legal documents you need to start operating, maintain compliance, and avoid the nightmare of a magistrate shutting down your office.

## Part 1: The "Must-Have" Core Documents

### 1. Trade License: The Birth Certificate
You cannot legally sell a pin or a plane in Bangladesh without a Trade License. It grants you permission to conduct business in a specific local area.
*   **Where to get it:** Your local City Corporation (North/South in Dhaka) or Union Parishad office.
*   **Cost:** Varies by business type (commercial vs. industrial) and location. BDT 5,000 to BDT 50,000 is common.
*   **Validity:** 1 year. Must be renewed every July.
*   **The Trap:** Do not register a generic "General Supplier" license if you are a software company. Be specific. Banks may reject your loan application later if the license category doesn't match your business activity.

### 2. TIN (Tax Identification Number)
The E-TIN is arguably the easiest document to get (it's instant online), but it carries the heaviest weight.
*   **Company TIN:** Your Limited Company must have its own TIN, separate from your personal TIN.
*   **Reporting:** Once you have a TIN, you *must* file a tax return annually, even if your income is zero. Failure to file results in penalties starting from BDT 5,000.

### 3. BIN (Business Identification Number) / VAT Registration
This is where it gets tricky. VAT is separate from Income Tax.
*   **Who needs it?** Any business with an annual turnover of BDT 30 Lakh+ or businesses involved in import/export/manufacturing/supply.
*   **The 13-Digit Number:** This allows you to issue VAT Challans (Mushak-6.3). Corporate clients like Grameenphone or BAT will *not* pay you if you cannot provide a VAT Challan.
*   **Monthly Filing:** Unlike Income Tax (annual), VAT returns (Mushak-9.1) must be filed *every month* by the 15th. Missing this deadline triggers an automatic fine of BDT 10,000.

### 4. RJSC Registration (Incorporation)
If you want to raise investment, you cannot be a Sole Proprietorship. You must incorporate a **Private Limited Company**.
*   **Authority:** Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms (RJSC).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Name Clearance:** Check if your name is available.
    2.  **Drafting:** Create Article of Association (AoA) and Memorandum of Association (MoA).
    3.  **Bank Account:** Open a temporary bank account and deposit paid-up capital.
    4.  **Submission:** Submit documents + encashment certificate.
    5.  **Certificate:** Receive Certificate of Incorporation (C.O.I).
*   **Why bother?** Limit your liability. If a Pvt Ltd company goes bankrupt, your personal house and car are safe. In a proprietorship, they are not.

## Part 2: Specialized Licenses

Depending on your vertical, the core 4 are not enough.

### For IT/Software Companies
*   **BASIS Membership:** Essential for IT companies to get the 10-year Tax Holiday. It is also required for bidding on government tenders.

### For E-Commerce
*   **DBID (Digital Business ID):** Every Facebook shop and website *must* register for a DBID. This was introduced to curb fraud in the e-commerce sector.

### For Import/Export
*   **IRC (Import Registration Certificate) & ERC (Export Registration Certificate):** You cannot clear goods from Chittagong Port without these.

### For Factories/Restaurants
*   **Fire License:** Verification that your premises meet fire safety standards.
*   **Environment Clearance:** Verification that you are not polluting.

## Part 3: Common Compliance Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Mixing Personal and Business Finances
Rookie founders use their personal bKash or savings account for business expenses.
*   ** The Risk:** This "pierces the corporate veil." In a lawsuit, a judge can say your company is a sham and seize your personal assets. Always use a dedicated business bank account.

### Mistake 2: Ignoring VAT Deductions at Source (VDS)
If you pay rent for your office, you are legally required to deduct VAT (usually 15%) from the rent and deposit it to the government on behalf of the landlord.
*   **The Risk:** During an audit, if you cannot prove you paid VDS, the NBR will demand that money from *you*, plus interest.

### Mistake 3: Using a Residential Address for Trade License
Commercial licenses usually require a commercial lease agreement.
*   **The Risk:** City Corporation inspectors can revoke your license if they find you operating a commercial office in a residential-only zone. However, for software companies, there is some leniency in certain residential areas (like startup hubs).

## Part 4: A Timeline for Compliance

*   **Day 1:** Name Clearance (RJSC) & Trade License application.
*   **Day 7:** E-TIN creation.
*   **Day 30:** Incorporation Complete. Bank Account Open.
*   **Day 45:** BIN (VAT) Registration.
*   **Day 60:** Specialized Licenses (BASIS, DBID, etc.).

## Part 5: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I do this all myself?**
A: Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. The RJSC system is complex. Hiring a lawyer or a specialized "Company Secretary" firm costs BDT 15k - 20k but saves you months of headache.

**Q: How much tax do I pay?**
A: Corporate tax is generally 27.5% to 30%. However, IT companies (BASIS members) pay 0% (Tax Holiday) until 2024 (likely to be extended). This is why BASIS membership is Critical.

**Q: What is "Speed Money"?**
A: It is an unfortunate reality in lower-level bureaucracy to "move files." However, digitization is reducing this. E-TIN and BIDA OSS are largely corruption-free. Stick to digital channels whenever possible.

## Conclusion

Compliance is not a one-time setup; it is an operational habit. It is the foundation upon which you build a skyscraper. If the foundation is weak (bad paperwork), the higher you build (revenue), the likely it is to collapse.

Invest in compliance early. The cost of "fixing" bad paperwork is 10x the cost of doing it right the first time.

> [!TIP]
> **Pro Tip:** Digitization is helping. Use the **BIDA OSS (One Stop Service)** portal where multiple licenses can theoretically be applied for at once. It's not perfect yet, but it's the future of doing business in Bangladesh.
