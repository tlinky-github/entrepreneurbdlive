**"Your Network is Your Net Worth." It is the biggest cliché in business. It is also completely true.**

In Bangladesh, business is deeply relational. Contracts are often signed not because you have the best PDF proposal, but because you have trust. A recommendation from a trusted "Bhai" or "Apa" is worth more than a million taka in Facebook Ads.

But "Networking" has a bad reputation. It sounds like transactional schmoozing in a 5-star hotel lobby, handing out business cards to strangers who will throw them away.

Real networking is about **Network Intelligence** and **Generosity**. It is farming, not hunting.

## Part 1: The Mindset Shift (Give First)

The biggest mistake rookies make is asking for a favor in the first meeting: "Can you invest?" "Can you give me a job?" "Can you buy this?"

### The Bank Account Metaphor
Relationships are bank accounts. You must make **deposits** (add value) before you can make a **withdrawal** (ask for a favor).
*   **How to Add Value:**
    *   Share a relevant article or report with them.
    *   Introduce them to a potential client or hire.
    *   Offer feedback on their product.
    *   Simply listen to their problems.

### The Long Game
If you meet someone today, don't expect a deal tomorrow. You are building a relationship for 2030. The person who is a Junior Executive today will be a CEO in 10 years. Grow with them.

## Part 2: The Science of Networking

### Weak Ties vs. Strong Ties
Sociologist Mark Granovetter discovered a paradox: **"The Strength of Weak Ties."**
*   **Strong Ties:** Your close friends and family. They know the same people and same information you do.
*   **Weak Ties:** Acquaintances (people you meet once a year). They bridge you to *new* worlds, new industries, and new information.
*   **Action:** Your next big opportunity will likely come from a "Weak Tie." Reach out to people you haven't spoken to in 6 months.

### The Super-Connectors
In every ecosystem, there are a few "Hubs"—people who know everyone.
*   **Strategy:** Identify the super-connectors in Dhaka (e.g., leaders of community groups, startup mentors). Building a relationship with one Connector is worth 100 cold calls.

## Part 3: Digital Networking (LinkedIn is Gold)

Dhaka's traffic makes physical networking hard. LinkedIn is the solution.

### The Content Strategy
Writing online (like this blog) scales your networking. You can build trust with 1,000 people simultaneously whilst you sleep.
*   **Comment Thoughtfully:** Don't just say "Great post." Add value. "I agree, and I also noticed that X..." This gets you noticed by the author.

### The Cold DM
A well-researched, polite, and short cold message works wonders.
*   **Bad:** "Hi, I want to pitch you."
*   **Good:** "Hi X, I read your article on Fintech. I loved your point about regulation. I am building something in that space and had one specific question about Y. No pressure to reply." (This gets an 80% response rate).

## Part 4: Curating Your Circle

You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.
*   **The Energy Audit:** Who drains you? Who energizes you? Ruthlessly edit your circle. If you want to be a millionaire, stop hanging out with people who complain about the economy all day. Spend time with Optimists.

## Part 5: Case Study: The "Volunteer"

**Scenario:** A student wanted to break into the startup world but had no connections.
**Strategy:** Instead of asking for a job, he volunteered at every startup event (Startup Grind, organizing committee). He carried boxes, checked tickets, and served coffee.
**Result:** He met every VIP speaker in a non-threatening environment. They saw his work ethic. Six months later, one of them hired him as a Head of Operations.
**Lesson:** Service leads to Status.

## Part 6: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: I am an introvert. Can I network?**
A: Introverts are often *better* networkers because they are better listeners. Networking isn't about being the loudest in the room; it's about connecting deeply one-on-one.

**Q: How do I follow up?**
A: Send a "Nice to meet you" email within 24 hours. Reference something specific you discussed ("I hope your dog feels better"). This anchors the memory.

## Conclusion

Networking is not about how many contacts you have in your phone. It is about how many people would pick up your call when you are in trouble.

Build your well before you are thirsty.
